# Concept
The concept of this game is that it is a simple game where the player cont.rols a small sprite on the screen moving it up or down to avoid obstacles or to get points. The player must collect yellow points in order to increase the score, but as they increase in score, the speed of the objects they must avoid also increases. This continues until the plyer either has -100 score, at which point the game ends, or the player can get 1000 score in order to win the game.
