# Concept
When we were given this assignment, I though it  would be interesting to do a simple point a shoot game. I started out the assignment by mmaking a brief model of how I wanted to make the game, then I begn the process of building the game, using my models as a guide. The concept of this game is that it is a simple game where the player controls a small sprite on the screen moving it up or down to avoid obstacles or to get points. The player must collect yellow points in order to increase the score, but as they increase in score, the speed of the objects they must avoid also increases. This continues until the plyer either has -100 score, at which point the game ends, or the player can get 1000 score in order to win the game.

# Functionality
The program consists of three modes, or three screens. The initial screen on startup is the main menu, where the user must select which mode, or screen, to go to next. The options are the settings mode or the  game mode, which can be accessed by the sttings buttons and the play butoons respectively. When the user clicks on the play buttons, a countdown starts, and when it finishes the user can start playing the game.

If the user clicks on the settings screen at the menu, they go  to the settings mode. In the settings me, the user can tweak the settings of the game, and when they have finished they can press the home button to gto back to the main menu mode, i.e. the main menu screen. They can then play the game on the settings they want.
